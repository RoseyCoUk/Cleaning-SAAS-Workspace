# Phase 2 - Final Fixes & Completion

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED (All review issues resolved)
**Time for Fixes:** ~25 minutes
**Build Status:** âœ… All builds passing

---

## Issues Identified by Codex Review

### Issue 1: Service Filter Not Working (HIGH) âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** The service filter dropdown in BookingsManager never affected results. Filter logic only checked `statusFilter` and `frequencyFilter`.

**Location:** `src/components/cleaning/BookingsManager.tsx:88-96`

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Added service filter logic
if (serviceFilter !== "all") {
  const bookingService = booking.service.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, "-");
  if (bookingService !== serviceFilter && !bookingService.includes(serviceFilter.replace("-", ""))) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Testing:**
- âœ… Filter by "Deep" shows only Deep Clean bookings
- âœ… Filter by "Regular" shows only Regular Clean bookings
- âœ… Filter by "Move-Out" shows only Move-Out bookings
- âœ… Combined filters work (Status + Frequency + Service)

**Time:** 5 minutes

### Issue 2: Team Calendar View Placeholder (MEDIUM) âœ… DOCUMENTED

**Problem:** Calendar view toggle showed "coming soon" placeholder instead of actual calendar.

**Location:** `src/components/cleaning/TeamScheduleTab.tsx:143`

**Decision:** **Option B - Defer to Phase 4** (as approved by user)

**Rationale:**
- List view is fully functional for job assignment
- Shared Calendar component can be integrated in Phase 4 (50 min)
- Avoids scope creep in Phase 2
- Better to do it properly later than rush it now

**Documentation Created:**
- `PHASE-4-TEAM-CALENDAR-PLAN.md` - Complete implementation guide
- Estimated time: 50 minutes
- Two options documented: Shared Calendar (quick) vs Custom Grid (better UX)
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Ready for Phase 4 implementation

**Status:** âœ… Properly deferred with clear plan

### Issue 3: Photo Upload Validation (MEDIUM) âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** HTML5 `max` attribute doesn't enforce file count limits. No validation existed, staff could submit 0 photos or 100+ photos.

**Location:** `src/components/staff/StaffTodayTab.tsx:116`

**Fixes Applied:**

#### 1. File Count Validation (1-5 required)
```typescript
const handleFileSelect = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const files = Array.from(e.target.files || []);

  // Validate file count
  if (files.length < 1 || files.length > 5) {
    setPhotoError("Please select 1-5 photos");
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of validation
};
```

#### 2. File Type Validation
```typescript
// Validate file types
const validTypes = ["image/jpeg", "image/jpg", "image/png", "image/heic"];
const invalidFiles = files.filter(f => !validTypes.includes(f.type));
if (invalidFiles.length > 0) {
  setPhotoError("Please upload only image files (JPG, PNG, HEIC)");
  return;
}
```

#### 3. Completion Validation
```typescript
const handlePhotoUploadDone = (jobId: string) => {
  // Validate files before completing
  if (selectedFiles.length < 1 || selectedFiles.length > 5) {
    setPhotoError("Please upload 1-5 photos before completing the job");
    return;
  }
  // ... complete job
};
```

#### 4. Photo Previews
- Grid layout showing all selected photos
- 3-column grid with square aspect ratio
- Border highlighting for selected photos
- Shows count: "3 photos selected"
- Preview URLs properly cleaned up on cancel/complete

#### 5. UI Improvements
- "Confirm & Complete" button disabled until 1-5 photos selected
- Error messages display in red below file input
- Cancel button properly cleans up preview URLs (no memory leaks)
- Header changed to "Upload Job Photos (1-5 required)" for clarity

**Testing:**
- âœ… Can't complete with 0 photos (shows error)
- âœ… Can't complete with 6+ photos (shows error)
- âœ… Can select 1-5 photos and complete successfully
- âœ… Preview shows all selected photos
- âœ… File type validation works (rejects non-images)
- âœ… Cancel properly cleans up state
- âœ… Multiple upload sessions work correctly

**Time:** 20 minutes (10 min validation + 10 min previews)

## Additional Fix: Memory Leak in Photo Reselection

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Issue Found By:** Codex (second review)

### Problem
When users reselected photos while the upload dialog remained open, the previous preview URLs were never revoked. Each reselection created new blob URLs without cleaning up the old ones, causing memory leaks.

**Location:** `src/components/staff/StaffTodayTab.tsx:65`

### Fix Applied
Added cleanup at the start of `handleFileSelect` to revoke existing preview URLs before creating new ones:

```typescript
const handleFileSelect = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const files = Array.from(e.target.files || []);

  // Revoke existing preview URLs before creating new ones to prevent memory leaks
  photoPreviewUrls.forEach(url => URL.revokeObjectURL(url));
  
  // ... rest of validation and new URL creation
};
```

### Testing
- âœ… Selecting photos multiple times doesn't leak memory
- âœ… Old blob URLs are properly revoked before creating new ones
- âœ… Preview updates correctly on reselection
- âœ… No memory buildup over repeated selections

### Time
2 minutes

**Phase 2 Final Status:** âœ… **100% COMPLETE** (All memory leaks resolved)
